HotStuff introduced in Yin et al. (2018) is a byzantine fault tolerant system
protocol that is used to achieve consensus between the nodes of a distributed
system. Usually, implementations involve network communication among distributed nodes, which introduces significant implementation complexity. This
project aims to simulate the protocolâ€™s behavior locally using threads to represent
individual replicas, allowing the study of HotStuff in many practical environment.
